## What Is the No Surprise Act and Why It Matters

### Quick Overview
The No Surprise Act (NSA) is a federal law designed to protect patients from unexpected (or “surprise”) medical bills, especially when you had no real choice of using an in-network provider. Effective nationwide since January 1, 2022, the NSA targets high-cost scenarios such as emergency services and non-emergency services delivered by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities.

In California, this federal law works alongside the state’s existing, and often stronger, AB 72 legislation. In 2025, the two sets of rules collectively ensure that Californians can access medical care with greater financial transparency and fewer nasty surprises.

### Why It Matters

- Protects Your Wallet: Unexpectedly large bills can quickly lead to debt or cause you to delay necessary care. The NSA and AB 72 reduce your out-of-pocket exposure.
- Gives You Peace of Mind: Even in emergency situations—where you can’t shop around for an in-network provider—most charges must now be billed at in-network rates.
- Promotes Transparency: Both federal and state rules compel providers and facilities to disclose network status and potential costs up front, so you can make better-informed decisions.

## What Is “Balance Billing”—a.k.a. “Surprise Billing”?

CALL OUT SECTION: An estimated **1 in 5** emergency claims involve out-of-network charges, which leads to surprise bills 

### Definition
Balance Billing, often called Surprise Billing, happens when an out-of-network provider bills you for the difference between their full charge and what your insurance plan has agreed to pay.

For instance, if an out-of-network anesthesiologist charges $2,000 but your insurance plan only covers $1,200, the provider could bill you the remaining $800—unless there’s a law preventing them from doing so.

### Where It Commonly Occurs
- Emergency Situations: You may not have a choice in which hospital or specialist treats you.
- In-Network Hospitals with Out-of-Network Specialists: You can be treated at an in-network facility but encounter a surgeon, radiologist, or other specialist who is not in your plan’s network.

The No Surprise Act and California’s AB 72 specifically prohibit or limit these types of extra charges in most scenarios.

## What’s Covered for Patients in California
### California patients are protected under two complementary sets of rules:

No Surprise Act (Federal)

- Emergency Services: You’re charged your normal in-network rates even if the hospital and physicians are out of network.
- Post-Stabilization Care: Once you’re stable, you can’t be balance billed if you had no meaningful choice to transfer to an in-network provider.
- Non-Emergency Services at In-Network Facilities: If you unknowingly receive care from an out-of-network specialist, you owe no more than the in-network cost share.

AB 72 (California Law)

- Non-Emergency Services at In-Network Facilities (State-Regulated Plans): Out-of-network providers cannot bill beyond in-network rates.
- - Emergency Services: Offers state-level protections that overlap with or surpass federal rules.
- Greater Transparency & Notice Requirements: California often enforces stricter guidelines about disclosing out-of-network rates, helping you avoid unintentionally signing consent forms.

> **Scenarios to Note**
> - In-Network Hospital, Out-of-Network Doctor: Under both the NSA and AB 72, you’re generally not responsible for paying more than in-network cost sharing.
> - Self-Funded Employer Plans: Large employers often self-fund their plans, making them exempt from some California regulations. The NSA still protects you in most surprise billing situations.


### What’s Not Covered (or Still in Limbo)
Ground Ambulances

- Current Gap: Neither the NSA nor AB 72 provides comprehensive protections against ground ambulance balance billing.
- California Updates: As of February 2025, proposals in the state legislature aim to regulate ground ambulance billing more tightly, but no new laws have yet taken effect.

Certain Short-Term or Limited-Benefit Plans

- Not all insurance products fall under the scope of the NSA or AB 72. If you have a limited or short-term plan, you may need to check whether balance billing protections apply.

Voluntary Out-of-Network Care

- If you choose an out-of-network provider and sign a consent form acknowledging you’ll pay more, you may waive your protections in non-emergency situations.

## Key Takeaways for California Patients
### Always Verify Network Status

Double-check with your insurer that facilities and providers are in-network—especially for scheduled procedures.

### Review Bills and Explanation of Benefits (EOBs)

If you spot a charge above what you believe your in-network cost would be, contact your insurance and reference the No Surprise Act (or AB 72, if you have a California-regulated plan).

Use Dispute Resolution If Needed

AB 72 includes an Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) process for state-regulated plans.
The federal IDR applies to self-funded or other plans covered primarily by the NSA.
In both cases, the goal is to keep you out of direct negotiations and shield you from inflated bills.

### Know Your Consumer Rights

You are not obligated to pay balance bills that violate federal or state protections.
Contact the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) or your insurer if you receive an unexpected out-of-network charge.

## Final Thoughts
Balancing state and federal regulations can be confusing, but California’s approach works to keep the burden off patients. If you ever feel stuck with a bill that doesn’t align with in-network rates, remember:

You can’t be billed above in-network rates in most emergency or in-network facility situations.
Stricter disclosure requirements in California ensure you receive timely, accurate cost and network information.
Ground ambulance billing remains a challenge, so keep an eye on legislative developments in 2025 and beyond.
By knowing your rights under the No Surprise Act and AB 72, you can protect your finances and focus on what truly matters: your health.
