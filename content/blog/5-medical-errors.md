**Meta Title Tag:** 5 Common Medical Billing Errors That Cost Patients Thousands | How to Avoid Overpaying

**Meta Description:** Learn how to identify and avoid common medical billing errors—like duplicate charges, upcoding, and unbundling—that can cost you thousands. Follow these tips to protect your wallet.

Medical bills can be confusing and overwhelming, and it’s not uncommon to find **common medical billing errors** that inflate costs and leave you paying far more than you owe. Understanding these errors will help you **spot medical bill mistakes**, dispute inaccurate charges, and ultimately prevent thousands of dollars in unnecessary expenses.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the most frequent and costly medical billing issues—from **duplicate charges on medical bills** to **unbundling services**—and show you how to correct them. With the right knowledge and resources, you can protect yourself and ensure you’re only paying for the care you actually receive.

## Don’t Just Ask for an Itemized Bill—Request a UB-04

Before diving into the common errors, here’s a crucial tip that can save you time and frustration. If you were treated as an outpatient at a hospital (which is often the case), consider asking for the hospital’s UB-04 form instead of a generic “itemized bill.” The UB-04 is a standardized claim form hospitals use when submitting charges to insurance companies. Unlike ordinary itemized bills, which can vary widely, the UB-04 adheres to a clear, uniform format, giving you a reliable snapshot of every service, code, and charge. By requesting the UB-04 directly, you avoid the back-and-forth of debating what constitutes a true “itemized” bill and get straight to the consistent, standardized details you need.

### 1. Duplicate Charges

**What It Is:** **Duplicate charges** occur when the same test, procedure, or service is billed more than once. This often happens when different departments fail to coordinate or when billing staff mistakenly submit a charge twice.

**Example:** You have an MRI of the brain coded as CPT 70551. Your bill shows this MRI charge twice on the same date of service, resulting in double billing for a single procedure.

**Why It Costs You:** A test like an MRI might cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. If it’s billed twice, you could be paying double for a procedure you only had once.

**How to Spot It:** Request an itemized bill and compare it against your insurance Explanation of Benefits (EOB). If you see identical procedures listed multiple times for the same date, contact the billing department immediately.

### 2. Upcoding

**What It Is:** **Upcoding** is when providers bill for a more expensive service than the one you received. For example, a standard follow-up office visit (often coded as CPT 99213) might be billed as a more complex evaluation and management visit (e.g., CPT 99215).

**Example:** You visited your primary care doctor for a routine follow-up, which should be billed as CPT 99213 (moderate complexity). However, your bill shows CPT 99215 (high complexity), implying a more extensive and costly visit than you actually had.

**Why It Costs You:** A routine office visit may cost around $100, but a high-complexity consultation could jump to $300 or more, tripling your out-of-pocket expense.

**How to Spot It:** Match the codes on your bill to the level of service you recall receiving. Use resources like [Fair Health Consumer](https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/) to verify typical costs. If it seems inflated, consider disputing the charge.

### 3. Unbundling of Services

**What It Is:** **Unbundling services** involves billing for individual components of a procedure separately when they should be grouped under one bundled code. For example, a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP), commonly coded as CPT 80048, might be broken down into separate charges for each test—like sodium (CPT 84295), potassium (CPT 84132), and so on—instead of the discounted panel rate.

**Example:** Instead of seeing one line item (CPT 80048) for the BMP test on your bill, you see multiple line items for each component test. This practice raises your total cost significantly.

**Why It Costs You:** One bundled test might cost $50, while billing each component separately could push the total to $100 or more.

**How to Spot It:** If your bill lists multiple lab test codes that look like they belong together, call the billing department and ask if these should be bundled under a single code.

### How to Prevent and Dispute Medical Bill Errors

- **Request an Itemized Bill or a UB-04:** An itemized statement breaks down every charge, making it easier to spot mistakes.
- **Compare with Your EOB:** The EOB from your insurer shows what they covered and what’s left for you to pay. Discrepancies between your bill and EOB can signal errors.
- **Look Up Medical Codes:** Websites like [Fair Health Consumer](https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/) help you confirm that codes match the services you received.
- **Contact the Billing Department:** Don’t hesitate to call and ask for clarification or dispute questionable charges.
- **Seek Assistance if Needed:** If errors persist, consider hiring a medical billing advocate or consulting consumer advocacy groups. A resource such as [the CFPB’s guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) can provide additional help.
