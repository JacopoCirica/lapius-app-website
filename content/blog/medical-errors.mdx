## Don’t Just Ask for an Itemized Bill—Request a UB-04

Before diving into the common errors, here’s a crucial tip that can save you time and frustration. If you were treated as an outpatient at a hospital (which is often the case), consider asking for the hospital’s UB-04 form instead of a generic “itemized bill.” The UB-04 is a standardized claim form hospitals use when submitting charges to insurance companies.

Unlike ordinary itemized bills, which can vary widely, the UB-04 adheres to a clear, uniform format, giving you a reliable snapshot of every service, code, and charge. By requesting the UB-04 directly, you avoid the back-and-forth of debating what constitutes a true “itemized” bill.

## 1. Duplicate Charges

**What It Is:** **Duplicate charges** occur when the same test, procedure, or service is billed more than once.

**Example:** You have an MRI of the brain coded as CPT 70551. Your bill shows this MRI charge twice on the same date of service.

**Why It Costs You:** A test like an MRI might cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. If it’s billed twice, you could be paying double.

**How to Spot It:** Request an itemized bill and compare it against your insurance Explanation of Benefits (EOB). If you see identical procedures listed multiple times for the same date, contact the billing department.

## 2. Upcoding

**What It Is:** **Upcoding** is when providers bill for a more expensive service than the one you received. For example, a standard follow-up office visit (often coded as CPT 99213) might be billed as a more complex evaluation and management visit (e.g., CPT 99215).

**Example:** You visited your primary care doctor for a routine follow-up, which should be billed as CPT 99213 (moderate complexity). However, your bill shows CPT 99215 (high complexity), implying a more extensive and costly visit than you actually had.

**Why It Costs You:** A routine office visit may cost around $100, but a high-complexity consultation could jump to $300 or more, tripling your out-of-pocket expense.

**How to Spot It:** Match the codes on your bill to the level of service you recall receiving. Use resources like [Fair Health Consumer](https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/) to verify typical costs. If it seems inflated, consider disputing the charge.

## 3. Unbundling of Services

**What It Is:** **Unbundling services** involves billing for individual components of a procedure separately when they should be grouped under one bundled code.

**Example:** A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP), commonly coded as CPT 80048, might be broken down into separate charges for each test.

**Why It Costs You:** One bundled test might cost $50, while billing each component separately could push the total to $100 or more.

**How to Spot It:** If your bill lists multiple lab test codes that look like they belong together, call the billing department and ask if these should be bundled under a single code.

## How to Prevent and Dispute Medical Bill Errors

- **Request an Itemized Bill or a UB-04:** An itemized statement breaks down every charge, making it easier to spot mistakes.
- **Compare with Your EOB:** The EOB from your insurer shows what they covered and what’s left for you to pay.
- **Look Up Medical Codes:** Websites like [Fair Health Consumer](https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/) help you confirm that codes match the services you received.
- **Contact the Billing Department:** Don’t hesitate to call and ask for clarification or dispute questionable charges.
- **Seek Assistance if Needed:** If errors persist, consider hiring a medical billing advocate or consulting consumer advocacy groups. A resource such as [the CFPB’s guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) can provide additional help.
